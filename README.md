# DApp template
React/Mui dapp-template

## Installing

Make sure your system has *node* and *npm* installed.

Then install the package.json dependencies:
```
cd ./dapp-template

npm install
```

Then run the development server:
```
npm start
```

Use a chromium-based browser to go to `https://localhost:3000`

Note: the browser used for development should be chromium-based because most wallet plugins are only available for Chrome
